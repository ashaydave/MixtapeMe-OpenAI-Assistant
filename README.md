Mixtape-Me is a function calling OpenAI Assistant that uses the Brightdata web scraping browser (with pupeeteer library) to return Youtube mixes with a specified keyword, such as a music genre.

To use, create a .env file and put down your OPENAI_API_KEY.
Then in webScraper.js, put your ID from Brightdata in "SBR_WS_ENDPOINT".
